## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. Positive anything is better than negative nothing<br/>_**0-positive_or_negative.c**_ assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
+ [x] 1\. The last digit<br/>_**1-last_digit.c**_ assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.

+ [ ] 3\. alphABET<br/>_**3-print_alphabets.c**_ prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
+ [ ] 4\. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off<br/>_**4-print_alphabt.c**_ prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
+ [ ] 5\. Numbers<br/>_**5-print_numbers.c**_ prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.
+ [ ] 6\. Numberz<br/>_**6-print_numberz.c**_ prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.
+ [ ] 7\. Smile in the mirror<br/>_**7-print_tebahpla.c**_ prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
