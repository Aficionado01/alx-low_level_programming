# Pointers, Arrays and Strings

This project contains __C__ tasks for learning about pointers, arrays and strings.

## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. memset<br/>_**0-memset.c**_ contains a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
+ [x] 1\. memcpy<br/>_**1-memcpy.c**_ contains a function that copies memory area.
+ [x] 2\. strchr<br/>_**2-strchr.c**_ contains a function that locates a character in a string.
+ [ ] 3\. strspn<br/>_**3-strspn.c**_ contains a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
+ [ ] 4\. strpbrk<br/>_**4-strpbrk.c**_ contains a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
+ [ ] 5\. strstr<br/>_**5-strstr.c**_ contains a function that locates a substring.
+ [ ] 6\. Chess is mental torture<br/>_**7-print_chessboard.c**_ contains a function that prints the chessboard.
+ [ ] 7\. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire<br/>_**8-print_diagsums.c**_ contains a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
