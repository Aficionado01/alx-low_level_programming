# Functions And Nested Loops

This project contains __C__ tasks for learning functions and nested loops.

## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. _putchar_<br/>_**0-holberton.c**_ prints `Holberton`, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 1\. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game<br/>_**1-alphabet.c**_ prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 2\. 10 x alphabet<br/>_**2-print_alphabet_x10.c**_ prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 3\. islower<br/>_**3-islower.c**_ checks for lowercase character.
+ [x] 4\. isalpha<br/>_**4-isalpha.c**_ checks for alphabetic character.
+ [x] 5\. Sign<br/>_**5-sign.c**_ prints the sign of a number.
+ [x] 6\. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you<br/>_**6-abs.c**_ computes the absolute value of an integer.
+ [ ] 7\. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important<br/>_**7-print_last_digit.c**_ prints the last digit of a number.
+ [ ] 8\. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life<br/>_**8-24_hours.c**_ prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
+ [ ] 9\. Learn your times table<br/>_**9-times_table.c**_ prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
+ [ ] 10\. a + b<br/>_**10-add.c**_ adds two integers and returns the result.
+ [ ] 11\. Holberton School, 98 Battery Street, the OG<br/>_**11-print_to_98.c**_ prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line.
